# Kruskals-Maze-Generator-and-Solver

As part of my CSE datastructures and algorithms class at the University of Washington, my partner and I worked on this 
maze generator and solver. 

Datastructures Implemented: ArrayDisjointSet, ArrayHeap, ChainedHashSet, DoubleLinkedList, KVPair, ArrayDictionary,
ChainedHashDictionary, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees.

Interfaces Implemented: IDictionary, IDisjointSet, IList, IPriorityQueue, ISet

Algorithms Implemented/Learned: Dijkstra's, Kruskal's, Primm's, Floyd's Buildheap, Breath First Search, Depth First Search, 
various sorting algorithms. 

Tests Implemented: Functionality and stress tests for all datastructures and algorithms implemented.

This program generates a random maze and solves it by finding the shortest possible path between the start and the end.
